# Motor Characterization Stand

A motor characterization stand is a device used to determine a motor's parameter. This stand is being designed to measure the following parameters of a brushless Direct Current (BLDC) motors: thrust, torque, rotational speed, and power consumption.

## Features

- esp32 microcontroller
- load cells with the HX711(load cell amplifier) to measure both torque and thrust
- IR sensor to measure rotational speed
- INA226 to measure power consumption
